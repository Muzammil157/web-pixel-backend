## [2026-04-22] Remove deprecated Shopify Checkout API fetch — use pixel payload directly

**Branch:** `hubspot-new`
**File changed:** `index.js` only — removed `fetchFullCheckoutFromShopify`, simplified `/checkout-completed`

### Problem being fixed

`GET /admin/api/2026-01/checkouts/{token}.json` is fully deprecated by Shopify and returns:
`"The REST Checkout API is deprecated"` regardless of scopes.

### Changes

- **Removed** `fetchFullCheckoutFromShopify()` entirely
- **`/checkout-completed`** now uses the pixel payload (`req.body`) as the sole data source:
  - `email`, `first_name`, `last_name` — read directly from pixel payload
  - `line_items` — pixel payload (carries `image_url` + `url` from storefront)
  - `checkoutUrl` — constructed from token: `https://{shop}/checkouts/{token}`
- Removed all `checkout` / `fullCheckout` / `webhookCheckout` branching — single source now

### Pixel payload must include (no change from previous requirement)

```js
token: checkout.token,
first_name: checkout.billingAddress?.firstName,
last_name: checkout.billingAddress?.lastName,
email: checkout.email,
line_items: checkout.lineItems.map(item => ({
  title, quantity, price, sku,
  image_url: item.variant?.image?.url || "",
  url: item.variant?.product?.url || "",
}))
```

### What was NOT changed
- All HubSpot create/update/search/segmentation logic — untouched
- `generateCartHTML` — untouched
- `reconcileOrderContact` — untouched

## [2026-04-22] Fix cart HTML using pixel line_items instead of Admin API line_items

**Branch:** `hubspot-new`
**File changed:** `index.js` only — 1 line change

### Problem being fixed

`generateCartHTML(checkout.line_items)` was passing Admin API line items, which have no inline images or product URLs — every cart item rendered with a grey placeholder box and a dead `#` link.

The pixel payload line_items carry `image_url` and `url` from the storefront. These map directly to the fallback chain in `generateCartHTML` (`item.image_url`, `item.url`).

### Fix

```js
// Before:
generateCartHTML(checkout.line_items)

// After:
generateCartHTML(webhookCheckout.line_items || checkout.line_items)
```

Pixel line_items are tried first (has images + URLs). Admin API line_items are the fallback (safe, no crash, just grey boxes).

### What was NOT changed
- All other cart HTML logic — untouched
- All HubSpot/segmentation logic — untouched
- Admin API fetch — still used for email, names, checkout URL

## [2026-04-21] Reliable checkout URL for shopify_checkout_url property

**Branch:** `hubspot-new`
**File changed:** `index.js` only — 1 targeted change in `/checkout-completed`

### Problem being fixed

`abandoned_checkout_url` is often empty for Shopify Web Pixel events. `checkoutUrl` fell back to `checkout.web_url` but if that was also missing the property was written as an empty string.

### New priority chain for `checkoutUrl`

```
1. checkout.web_url               ← live checkout page URL from Admin API (most reliable)
2. checkout.abandoned_checkout_url ← Shopify recovery URL (fallback)
3. https://{shop}/checkouts/{token} ← constructed from token (guaranteed fallback when token present)
```

`web_url` from the Admin API response is the actual checkout page URL the customer was on when the pixel event fired. It is now the primary source instead of `abandoned_checkout_url`.

### What was NOT changed
- All HubSpot create/update/search logic — untouched
- All segmentation flag logic — untouched
- `generateCartHTML` — untouched
- `fetchFullCheckoutFromShopify` — untouched
- `reconcileOrderContact` — untouched

## [2026-04-20] Shopify Admin API checkout fetch + generateCartHTML crash fix

**Branch:** `hubspot-new`
**File changed:** `index.js` only — 1 new function, 1 function fix, 1 route refactor

### Problem being fixed

Two issues:
1. Webhook payload `line_items` from Shopify Web Pixel uses a different schema than the Admin API — field paths like `item.variant.price.amount` crash with `Cannot read properties of null` when `item.variant` is null or absent.
2. `abandoned_checkout_url` / `checkout_url` in webhook payload are unreliable — often empty for pixel events; the Shopify Admin API `GET /checkouts/{token}.json` returns the authoritative checkout object including `web_url`, real customer addresses, and full line item detail.

### `fetchFullCheckoutFromShopify(checkoutToken)` — new async helper

Added directly before `generateCartHTML`. Calls:
```
GET https://{shop}/admin/api/2026-01/checkouts/{token}.json
```
with `X-Shopify-Access-Token`. Returns `checkout` object on success, `null` on failure (never throws). Shop domain resolved from `SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN` env var, falls back to hardcoded `medical-and-lab-supplies.myshopify.com`.

### `generateCartHTML` — safe optional chaining fix

Old (crashes when `item.variant` is null):
```js
const price      = item.variant.price.amount        || "0.00";
const imageUrl   = item.variant.image.src           || item.image_url || "";
const productUrl = item.variant.product.url         || item.product_url || item.variant_url || "#";
```

New (safe fallback chain):
```js
const price      = item.variant?.price?.amount || item.price || "0.00";
const imageUrl   = item.variant?.image?.src    || item.image || item.image_url || "";
const productUrl = item.variant?.product?.url  || item.url   || item.product_url || item.variant_url || "#";
```

### `/checkout-completed` — webhook as trigger only

**Before:** used `req.body` (webhook payload) directly for line items, URL, and customer name.

**After:**
1. Extract `webhookToken` from `req.body.token` or `req.body.checkout_token`
2. Call `fetchFullCheckoutFromShopify(webhookToken)` — if fetch succeeds, use returned object as `checkout`; otherwise fall back to `req.body`
3. Resolve `firstName`/`lastName` from `checkout.billing_address` → `checkout.shipping_address` → `checkout.first_name` → `webhookCheckout.first_name`
4. Resolve `email` from `checkout.email` → `webhookCheckout.email`
5. `checkoutUrl` now uses `checkout.abandoned_checkout_url || checkout.web_url || ""`
6. `generateCartHTML` now called with Admin API `checkout.line_items`

`firstName`/`lastName` variables replace all direct `checkout.first_name` / `checkout.last_name` references throughout the route (create path, update path, reconciliation map write).

### What was NOT changed
- All HubSpot create/update/search logic — untouched
- All segmentation flag logic — untouched
- All reconciliation map / checkoutTokenMap logic — untouched
- `reconcileOrderContact` — untouched
- `orders/create` webhook — untouched

## [2026-04-16] Abandoned cart HTML + checkout URL pushed to HubSpot

**Branch:** `hubspot-new`
**File changed:** `index.js` only — 1 new helper function, 2 injections into existing payloads

### New HubSpot contact properties required

> Create these in HubSpot before deploying: Settings → Properties → Contact → Create property

| Property | Type | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| `shopify_abandoned_cart_html` | Single-line text (or rich text) | `/checkout-completed` |
| `shopify_checkout_url` | Single-line text | `/checkout-completed` |

### `generateCartHTML(lineItems)` — new helper function

Placed directly above the `/checkout-completed` route. Takes `checkout.line_items` array and returns a single inline-CSS, table-based HTML string safe for email clients (Gmail, Outlook).

Per item renders:
- 100px product image (with `border-radius:8px`) — falls back to a grey placeholder `<div>` if no image URL
- Product title in bold
- `Rs. PRICE (Qty: X)`
- "View Product" link — falls back to `#` if no URL

Field resolution order per item:

| Field | Tries in order |
|---|---|
| Image | `item.image` → `item.image_url` |
| URL | `item.url` → `item.product_url` → `item.variant_url` → `"#"` |

Empty or missing `line_items` → returns `""` (never crashes).

### Injected into `/checkout-completed` (both paths)

Computed once before the if/else block:
```js
const abandonedCartHTML = generateCartHTML(checkout.line_items);
const checkoutUrl       = checkout.abandoned_checkout_url || checkout.checkout_url || "";
```

**Create path (new contact):** added to properties object alongside existing flags.

**Update path (existing contact, not already customer):** added to `updateProps` unconditionally — always reflects the latest checkout session regardless of segmentation flag guards.

### What was NOT changed
- `reconciliationMap` / `checkoutTokenMap` — untouched
- `reconcileOrderContact` — untouched
- `orders/create` webhook — untouched
- All segmentation flag logic — untouched
- All lifecycle logic — untouched

## [2026-04-16] HubSpot segmentation flags — shopify_has_order, shopify_is_abandoned, contact_attempted

**Branch:** `hubspot-new`
**File changed:** `index.js` only — 4 targeted edits

---

### Problem being fixed

HubSpot `lifecyclestage` is unreliable as a segmentation signal — it can only move forward, gets out of sync, and doesn't distinguish between:
- abandoned checkout vs completed purchase
- contacted lead vs un-contacted lead
- returning customer vs first-time buyer

### Three new HubSpot contact properties

> These properties must be created as **custom contact properties** in HubSpot before deployment.
> Go to: HubSpot → Settings → Properties → Contact properties → Create property

| Property | Type | Values | Set by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shopify_has_order` | Checkbox / Boolean | `"true"` / `"false"` | `orders/create` only |
| `shopify_is_abandoned` | Checkbox / Boolean | `"true"` / `"false"` | Checkout sets true; order sets false |
| `contact_attempted` | Checkbox / Boolean | `"true"` / `"false"` | Marketing flows only; code sets false as default |
| `last_contact_status` | Single-line text | `"attempted"` / `"emailed"` / `"replied"` | Marketing flows only (not set by this code) |

### Flag logic per event

#### Checkout pixel → `/checkout-completed`

**Create (new contact):**
```
shopify_has_order   = "false"
shopify_is_abandoned = "true"
contact_attempted   = "false"   ← default, marketing will override
```

**Update (existing contact, not yet a customer):**
```
shopify_has_order   = "false"   ← only if shopify_has_order is not already "true"
shopify_is_abandoned = "true"   ← only if shopify_has_order is not already "true"
contact_attempted   = "false"   ← only if not already "true" (preserves marketing state)
```

**Guard:** if `shopify_has_order === "true"` (returning customer starting new checkout), flags are NOT changed. Purchase truth is never overwritten by the checkout flow.

#### Order webhook → `reconcileOrderContact`

```
shopify_has_order   = "true"    ← ONLY place this is ever set to true
shopify_is_abandoned = "false"  ← cancels the abandoned state
lifecyclestage      = "customer"
contact_attempted   → NOT TOUCHED (engagement state is independent)
```

### What was changed (4 edits)

1. **`/checkout-completed` search** — added `shopify_has_order`, `shopify_is_abandoned`, `contact_attempted` to the `properties` array so we can read them before deciding what to write
2. **`/checkout-completed` create block** — added 3 flags to new contact properties
3. **`/checkout-completed` update block** — added 3 flags with guards (purchase truth protection + contact_attempted preservation)
4. **`findHubSpotContactByEmail`** — added same 3 properties to the search so `reconcileOrderContact` can read them; added `shopify_has_order`, `shopify_is_abandoned` to `customerProps` in `reconcileOrderContact`

### Contact classification after fix

| `shopify_has_order` | `shopify_is_abandoned` | `contact_attempted` | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `false` | `true` | `false` | Abandoned lead — never contacted |
| `false` | `true` | `true` | Abandoned lead — follow-up attempted |
| `true` | `false` | `false` | Customer — no follow-up needed |
| `true` | `false` | `true` | Customer — was previously contacted |

### What was NOT changed
- `reconciliationMap` / `checkoutTokenMap` logic — untouched
- `/connect-pixel` — untouched
- B2B PO number logic — untouched
- OAuth routes — untouched
- PayPal logic — untouched

## [2026-04-16] Checkout-token bridge + resilient order reconciliation

**Branch:** `hubspot-new`
**File changed:** `index.js` only — 4 targeted changes

### Problem being fixed

Email mismatch between checkout pixel and order webhook caused reconciliation to silently fail — users remained as "Guest" even after placing a real order because:
- `order.email` can differ from the pixel-submitted email (guest changes email at payment step)
- `order.email` can be absent entirely on some guest checkouts
- The old reconciliation only searched by email — if it missed, it created a new duplicate contact

### Changes made

#### 1. `checkoutTokenMap` added alongside `reconciliationMap`

```js
const checkoutTokenMap = new Map(); // checkout_token → email
```

Secondary index that acts as the bridge between the checkout pixel event and the order webhook. Populated when a checkout is received; consumed when an order is reconciled.

#### 2. `/checkout-completed` — store `checkout_token` in both maps

Extracts `checkout.token` (Shopify pixel field) from the payload.

- Added `checkout_token` field to `reconciliationMap` entry
- Stores `checkoutTokenMap.set(token, email)` for order-side lookup

#### 3. `/webhook/orders-create` — widen trigger condition

Was: `if (order.email && HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN)`
Now: `if (HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN && (order.email || order.checkout_token))`

Orders with no email but a checkout_token now also go through reconciliation.

#### 4. `reconcileOrderContact` — full 3-step matching + `findHubSpotContactByEmail` helper

**Step A — email match (existing logic, now in a reusable helper)**
Search HubSpot by `order.email`. Helper `findHubSpotContactByEmail` wraps the search call and returns `null` on failure (never throws).

**Step B — checkout_token bridge (new)**
If Step A finds nothing (or email is missing):
- Read `order.checkout_token`
- Look up `checkoutTokenMap` → get the pixel-submitted email
- Search HubSpot by that email instead
- Logs: `[HubSpot] Bridging order X via checkout_token → email@example.com`

**Last resort — create as customer**
If both steps miss: create a new contact using `resolvedEmail || order.billing_address.email`. Logs a warning and skips if no email can be resolved at all.

**Strong merge (updated)**
The PATCH now always sends real name data from the order (not conditional on "Guest"/"Shopify"):
```js
if (firstname) customerProps.firstname = firstname;
if (lastname)  customerProps.lastname  = lastname;
```
Order identity always overwrites whatever was in HubSpot.

### Matching flow after fix

```
Order received (orders/create)
        │
        ├── email present?
        │     YES → Step A: search HubSpot by order.email
        │               │
        │               ├── Contact found → PATCH to CUSTOMER + real names
        │               └── Not found → fall through to Step B
        │
        ├── checkout_token present?
        │     YES → Step B: checkoutTokenMap[token] → pixel email
        │               │
        │               ├── Email found in map → search HubSpot by pixel email
        │               │       ├── Contact found → PATCH to CUSTOMER + real names
        │               │       └── Not found → Last resort
        │               └── Token not in map → Last resort
        │
        └── Last resort
              └── Create new CUSTOMER contact (or skip if no email at all)
```

## [2026-04-16] HubSpot Lifecycle Reconciliation

**Branch:** `hubspot-new`
**File changed:** `index.js` only — 4 surgical additions, nothing else touched

---

### Problem being fixed

| Symptom | Root cause |
|---|---|
| Customers appear as "Guest" in HubSpot after placing orders | `/checkout-completed` used `"Guest"` / `"Shopify"` as name fallbacks |
| Completed customers still show as leads or unknown | No `lifecyclestage` was ever set on contact creation |
| Abandoned checkouts indistinguishable from real customers | Pixel event treated the same as a completed purchase |
| Duplicate contacts for the same person | No update path — "Contact already exists. Doing nothing." |
| No linkage between checkout pixel and order event | No reconciliation layer existed |

---

### Changes made (index.js)

#### 1. Reconciliation Map (added after existing `const` declarations)

```js
const reconciliationMap = new Map();
// Key: email
// Value: { status: 'LEAD'|'CUSTOMER', firstname, lastname, timestamp }
```

In-memory store that tracks each email's current lifecycle state.
Resets on server restart — HubSpot is the persistent source of truth.

---

#### 2. `/checkout-completed` — pixel event = LEAD only

**Search query updated** to fetch `firstname`, `lastname`, `lifecyclestage` (was only fetching `email`).

**If contact does not exist:**
- Was: `firstname: "Guest"`, `lastname: "Shopify"`, no `lifecyclestage`
- Now: real name from checkout payload (or empty string), `lifecyclestage: "lead"`

**If contact already exists:**
- Was: `"Contact already exists. Doing nothing."` — no update at all
- Now:
  - If `lifecyclestage` is not already `"customer"` → PATCH to `"lead"` (HubSpot lifecycle can only move forward, never backward, so customer is never downgraded)
  - Fixes placeholder names: if `firstname === "Guest"` or `lastname === "Shopify"`, overwrites with real data from checkout payload

**Reconciliation map updated** to `LEAD` after both paths.

---

#### 3. `/webhook/orders-create` — order event = CUSTOMER conversion

After the existing B2B PO number try/catch block (completely isolated — cannot affect existing Shopify logic):

```js
if (order.email && HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN) {
  reconcileOrderContact(order).catch(err =>
    console.error('[HubSpot] reconcileOrderContact error:', err.message)
  );
}
```

Fire-and-forget. Any HubSpot failure is logged and swallowed — the Shopify webhook response is always `200` and the B2B logic above is never affected.

---

#### 4. `reconcileOrderContact(order)` helper function (added before `app.listen`)

Called every time an order is created. Contains all the HubSpot promotion logic.

**Flow:**
```
Order received
      │
      ▼
Search HubSpot by email
      │
      ├── Contact found
      │     ├── PATCH lifecyclestage → "customer"
      │     ├── Fix firstname if "Guest" or empty → real name from order
      │     └── Fix lastname if "Shopify" or empty → real name from order
      │
      └── Contact NOT found
            └── POST new contact: email + real name + lifecyclestage: "customer"
      │
      ▼
Update reconciliationMap → { status: "CUSTOMER", ... }
```

Name resolution priority: `order.customer.first_name` → `order.billing_address.first_name` → `""`

---

### What was NOT changed

- `/connect-pixel` — untouched
- B2B PO number logic inside `/webhook/orders-create` — untouched
- All commented-out OAuth routes — untouched
- `app.use(cors(...))` and middleware — untouched
- Any other route or configuration — untouched

---

### Lifecycle model after fix

| Event | Source | HubSpot result |
|---|---|---|
| Customer submits checkout info (pixel) | `/checkout-completed` | Contact created/updated as **LEAD** |
| Customer abandons — no order follows | (no further event) | Stays as **LEAD** |
| Customer completes order | `/webhook/orders-create` | Contact promoted to **CUSTOMER**, placeholder names fixed |
| Order arrives with no prior checkout event | `/webhook/orders-create` | Contact created directly as **CUSTOMER** |
| Duplicate webhook for same order | `/webhook/orders-create` | PATCH is idempotent — no duplicate contacts |
